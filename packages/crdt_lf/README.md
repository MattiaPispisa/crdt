A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) implementation in Dart. 
This library provides solutions for:
- Text Editing.
- List Editing.
- Text Editing with Fugue Algorithm ([The Art of the Fugue: Minimizing Interleaving in Collaborative Text Editing" di Matthew Weidner e Martin Kleppmann](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583)).

## Features

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Hybrid Logical Clock**: Uses HLC for causal ordering of operations
- üîÑ **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves conflicts in a CRDT
- üì¶ **Local Availability**: Operations are available locally as soon as they are applied

## Getting Started

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  crdt_lf: ^1.0.0
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```dart
import 'package:crdt_lf/crdt_lf.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a new document
  final doc = CRDTDocument(
    peerId: PeerId.parse('45ee6b65-b393-40b7-9755-8b66dc7d0518'),
  );

  // Create a text handler
  final text = CRDTFugueTextHandler(doc, 'text1');

  // Insert text
  text.insert(0, 'Hello');

  // Delete text
  text.delete(0, 2); // Deletes "He"

  // Get current value
  print(text.value); // Prints "llo"
}
```

### [Flutter Distributed Collaboration Example](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/main/packages/crdt_lf/flutter_example)

## Sync 
A sync library is available in the [crdt_socket_sync](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/main/packages/crdt_socket_sync) package. And it's used to synchronize the CRDT state between peers. More info in the [README](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/main/packages/crdt_socket_sync/README.md) of the sync package.

A flutter example is available in the [flutter_example](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/main/packages/crdt_socket_sync/flutter_example) and provide a synced version of the  "Flutter Distributed Collaboration" Example.

## Architecture

The library is built: 
- above the [hlc_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/hlc_dart) package.
- around several key components:

### CRDTDocument
The main document class that manages the CRDT state and handles synchronization between peers.

### Handlers
Handlers are the core components of the library. They manage the state of a specific type of data and provide operations to modify it.

- `CRDTFugueTextHandler`: Handles text editing with the Fugue algorithm.
- `CRDTListHandler`: Handles list editing.
- `CRDTTextHandler`: Handles text editing.

### DAG
A Directed Acyclic Graph that maintains the causal ordering of operations.

### Change
Represents a modification to the CRDT state, including operation ID, dependencies, and timestamp.

### Frontiers
A structure that manages the frontiers (latest operations) of the CRDT.

### Snapshot
A snapshot of the CRDT state, including the version vector and the data.

## Project Status

This library is currently **in progress** and under active development. While all existing functionality is thoroughly tested, we are continuously working on improvements and new features.

### [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/MattiaPispisa/projects/1)
A roadmap is available in the [project](https://github.com/users/MattiaPispisa/projects/1) page. The roadmap provides a high-level overview of the project's goals and the current status of the project.
